# BLINKY-NODE
## A terminal interface for using your Blink(1) as a digital office door. 

### Purpose

So, I'm the CTO of a software firm. Only issue is we have an open office floor plan. This means I don't have a door to tell my co-workers that I'm hip deep in something. Instead of got a little light that tells them my status without them having to ask me what's going on. 

### Install

```
	yarn
	node .
```

That's it. Enjoy.
